This project is an example on how to compile Feelix's Treat code using a webpack Treat Plugin. This is achieved by using a tool called react-app-rewired. 
config-overrides.js contains setup for transpiling Feelix's treat code. Please reach out in Feelix's slack channel #svc-feelix for any questions or comments.
